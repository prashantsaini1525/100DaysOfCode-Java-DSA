## 📝 Day 29 – My Learning Log (2D Arrays in Practice)

### ✅ What I Learned Today:

- Created and printed hardcoded 2D arrays.
- Read user input into a 2D array of fixed dimensions.
- Traversed 2D arrays using nested loops and the `.length` property.
- Distinguished between row count (`matrix.length`) and column count (`matrix[0].length`).

### 💡 Concepts Practiced:

- **Hardcoded Initialization** vs. **Scanner-Based Input**.
- **Nested Loops** for traversal.
- **Resource Management**: Closing `Scanner`.

### 🧪 Implementation Details:

- 🔹 `TwoDArrayCreation0.java`: Demonstrated direct inline matrix creation and display.
- 🔹 `TwoDArrayCreation1.java`: Showcased populating a matrix via user input, with clear prompts.

### ✨ Key Reflections:

- Understanding that each row in a 2D array is itself a 1D array makes it intuitive to use `matrix[i].length` for columns.
- Scanner-based input emphasizes careful loop bounds and resource cleanup.
- Seeing the printed grid helps solidify how data is stored row by row.
