## 1. Introduction to 2D Arrays

Think of a **2D array** as a grid, like an Excel sheet: rows and columns. While a 1D array is a single line of values (`int[] scores = {80, 90, 75};`), a 2D array groups multiple such lines together:

```java
// Declaration of a 2D array with 3 rows and 4 columns
int[][] matrix = new int[3][4];
```

This structure is called a **multidimensional array**, and it’s really just an array of arrays under the hood.

### Why 2D Arrays?

- **Organization:** Store related data in a neat table.
- **Real-World Modeling:** Grids, images, game boards, etc.

## 2. Representation & Creation of 2D Arrays

### 2.1. Declaration Syntax

```java
// Method 1: declare and allocate
int[][] table = new int[2][5];

// Method 2: declare and initialize inline
int[][] predefined = {
  {1, 2, 3},
  {4, 5, 6},
  {7, 8, 9}
};
```

### 2.2. Accessing Elements

Use `[row][column]` indices, zero-based:

```java
int x = predefined[1][2]; // row 1, column 2 → 6
predefined[0][0] = 10;    // change 1 to 10
```

### 2.3. Iterating through 2D Arrays

```java
for (int i = 0; i < predefined.length; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < predefined[i].length; j++) {
        System.out.print(predefined[i][j] + " ");
    }
    System.out.println();
}
```

Or use enhanced for:

```java
for (int[] row : predefined) {
    for (int val : row) {
        System.out.print(val + " ");
    }
    System.out.println();
}
```

## 3. Real-Life Example: Student Marks

### 3.1. 1D Array for Single Student

```java
int[] aliceMarks = {85, 92, 78};
```

This holds Alice’s scores in, say, Math, Physics, and Chemistry.

### 3.2. 2D Array for Multiple Students

```java
int[][] allMarks = {
  {85, 92, 78},  // Alice
  {75, 68, 80},  // Bob
  {90, 88, 95}   // Carol
};
```

- Row 0 → Alice, Row 1 → Bob, Row 2 → Carol.
- Column 0 → Math, Column 1 → Physics, Column 2 → Chemistry.

### 3.3. Calculating Averages

```java
for (int i = 0; i < allMarks.length; i++) {
    int sum = 0;
    for (int j = 0; j < allMarks[i].length; j++) {
        sum += allMarks[i][j];
    }
    double avg = sum / (double) allMarks[i].length;
    System.out.printf("Student %d average: %.2f\n", i, avg);
}
```

## 4. RGB: Arrays in Image Processing

**RGB** stands for **Red, Green, Blue** – the three color channels that make up a digital image.

- Each pixel has three values: `[R, G, B]`, each 0–255.
- A full image can be stored as a **3D array**:

  - **Height** × **Width** × **3** (for R, G, B).

```java
int[][][] image = new int[height][width][3];
// image[i][j][0] → Red channel of pixel (i, j)
// image[i][j][1] → Green channel
// image[i][j][2] → Blue channel
```

### Why RGB Matters for 2D Arrays

- A 2D slice (one channel) is a 2D array of intensity values.
- Manipulate a channel by iterating through its 2D array.

## 5. Moving from 2D to 3D Arrays

Think of stacking multiple 2D sheets:

```java
// Suppose you want a 3D grid: depth × rows × cols
int depth = 4;
int rows = 3;
int cols = 3;
int[][][] cube = new int[depth][rows][cols];
```

- `cube[k]` is the k-th 2D array (sheet).
- Access via `cube[z][x][y]`.

Use cases:

- RGB images (depth = 3).
- Time-series of 2D data (e.g., daily weather maps).

---

## 6. Common Operations & Tips

- **Bounds Checking:** Always ensure indices are within `0 <= i < array.length` and `0 <= j < array[i].length`, else you’ll get `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.
- **Jagged Arrays:** Rows can differ in length:

  ```java
  int[][] jagged = new int[3][];
  jagged[0] = new int[2];
  jagged[1] = new int[4];
  jagged[2] = new int[1];
  ```

- **Copying Arrays:** Nested loops or `Arrays.copyOf()` for each row.
- **Memory Considerations:** Large grids can eat up memory quickly.

---

## 7. Further Explorations

- **Matrix Operations:** Addition, subtraction, multiplication.
- **Sparse Matrices:** Efficient storage.
- **Image Filters:** Convolution kernels on 2D arrays.
- **Higher Dimensions:** 4D arrays (e.g., video frames with RGB).
