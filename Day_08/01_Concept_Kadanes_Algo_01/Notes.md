# ðŸ“˜ Day 8: Kadaneâ€™s Algorithm â€” Bringing It All Together

After mastering triple-loop brute force (Day 6) and prefix sums (Day 7), youâ€™re ready for the _ultimate speed boost_: Kadaneâ€™s algorithm. This guide knits those earlier ideas into one smooth pass through your array.

## ðŸ”„ Quick Recap: Building Blocks

- **Day 6 â€“ Brute Force:** Checked every possible subarray with three loops (O(nÂ³)) to find max/min sums.
- **Day 7 â€“ Prefix Sums:** Precomputed running totals so each subarray sum took O(1), cutting loops to two (O(nÂ²)).

Both approaches taught you to:

1. **Enumerate** slices of your array.
2. **Aggregate** their sums.
3. **Optimize** repeated work.

Now letâ€™s see how Kadaneâ€™s merges these ideas into one pass.

## ðŸŒŸ The Key Insight: Keep or Reset

Think of your subarray sum like a scoring streak:

- **Current Streak (`currentSum`)**: Total score youâ€™re building right now.
- **Best Streak (`maxSum`)**: Highest score youâ€™ve ever reached.

As you visit each number in your array:

1. **Add** it to `currentSum`.
2. If `currentSum` ever **drops below zero**, itâ€™s hurting your future streakâ€”so **reset** it to 0.
3. **Update** `maxSum` with whichever is bigger: the old best or the new `currentSum`.

This simple rule replaces nested loops with a single sweep and just two variables:

- **Time**: O(n)
- **Space**: O(1)

## ðŸš€ Walkthrough with Code

Working array for today:

```java
int[] numbers = {-2, -3, 4, -1, -2, 1, 5, -3};
```

```java
// Time: O(n) | Space: O(1)
int maxSum = Integer.MIN_VALUE;  // Your best streak so far
int currentSum = 0;              // Streak youâ€™re building now

for (int num : numbers) {
    currentSum += num;           // Add todayâ€™s number
    if (currentSum < 0) {        // If the streak sours...
        currentSum = 0;          // ...reset and start fresh
    }
    maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, currentSum);  // Record new best if any
}

System.out.println("Max Subarray Sum is: " + maxSum);
```

> With this array, Kadaneâ€™s finds `[4, -1, -2, 1, 5]` for a sum of **7**.

## ðŸ’¡ Why This Feels Natural

- **Youâ€™re still tracking sums**â€”just without extra storage or loops.
- **Resetting negative sums** mirrors prefix-sum subtraction in DayÂ 7 but happens on the fly.
- **One pass** means lightning-fast performance.

Next, weâ€™ll tweak Kadaneâ€™s so it picks the _least negative_ number when every element is below zero. Stay tuned!
