# Introduction to Bit Manipulation

Bit manipulation is all about operating at the binary level of integer values. Java lets you inspect, set, clear, or toggle individual bits using built‑in operators, giving you ultra‑fast and memory‑efficient control.

## Core Ideas

- **Bits & Bytes**  
  – 1 byte = 8 bits  
  – `int` = 32 bits, `long` = 64 bits  
- **LSB vs MSB**  
  – LSB (position 0) is the smallest weight  
  – MSB is the highest‑weight bit  
- **Two’s‑Complement**  
  – Negatives are stored by inverting bits and adding one  

## Why It Matters

1. **Performance:** Bitwise ops run in constant time.  
2. **Memory Efficiency:** Pack multiple flags into a single number.  
3. **Common Uses:** Cryptography, compression, graphics, embedded systems.


## Conclusion

Understanding these fundamentals sets the stage for using bitwise operators effectively.
