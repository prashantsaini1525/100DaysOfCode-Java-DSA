# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 07, 2025

**Today's Progress**: Learned how to create arrays in Java, took input using Scanner, printed values, and passed the array to a method to observe changes.

**Thoughts:** It was exciting to start with arrays. Understanding how to manipulate them and observe changes through methods was insightful.

### Day 2: May 08, 2025

**Today's Progress**: Learned linear search in Javaâ€”stepped through each element to find a target value, counted how many checks it took, and returned the index (or â€“1 if not found).

**Thoughts**: Linear search helped me understand the importance of algorithm efficiency. It's motivating to see how these basic algorithms work.

### Day 3: May 09, 2025

**Today's Progress**: Learned to find the largest, second largest, and smallest elements in an array, calculate the sum of all elements, and implement binary search in Java.

**Thoughts** Diving deeper into array operations and binary search has been challenging but rewarding. Each concept builds upon the last, and I'm gaining confidence.

### Day 4: May 10, 2025

**Today's Progress**: Learned Reversed an array by swapping elements using a two-pointer technique, generated all unique pairs in an array with nested loops, and calculated the total number of pairs in Java both programmatically and via a combinatorial formula.

**Thoughts** This deep dive into two-pointer methods and nested loops strengthened my understanding of in-place algorithms and reinforced how mathematical reasoning can validate code outputs. Feeling more confident about array manipulations! ðŸ’ª

### Day 5: May 11, 2025

**Today's Progress**: Implemented a method to print all subarrays of a given array in Java. This includes:

- **Single-element subarrays**: Each individual element of the array.

- **Multi-element subarrays**: Subarrays containing at least two elements. This is achieved by starting the inner loop (`j`) from `i + 1`, ensuring each subarray has at least two elements.

- **Sum of each subarray**: Calculated and printed the sum of elements for each subarray.

- **Maximum and minimum of each subarray**: For each subarray, determined and printed the maximum and minimum values.

**Thoughts** This exercise enhanced my understanding of array manipulation and the importance of nested loops in generating subarrays. It also reinforced the significance of calculating sum, maximum, and minimum values for each subarray, which is crucial for various algorithmic problems. ðŸ’ª
