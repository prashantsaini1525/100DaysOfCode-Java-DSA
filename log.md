# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 07, 2025 

**Today's Progress**: Learned how to create arrays in Java, took input using Scanner, printed values, and passed the array to a method to observe changes.

**Thoughts:** It was exciting to start with arrays. Understanding how to manipulate them and observe changes through methods was insightful.

### Day 2: May 08, 2025

**Today's Progress**:  Learned linear search in Java—stepped through each element to find a target value, counted how many checks it took, and returned the index (or –1 if not found).

**Thoughts**: Linear search helped me understand the importance of algorithm efficiency. It's motivating to see how these basic algorithms work.

### Day 3: May 09, 2025

**Today's Progress**:  Learned to find the largest, second largest, and smallest elements in an array, calculate the sum of all elements, and implement binary search in Java.

**Thoughts** Diving deeper into array operations and binary search has been challenging but rewarding. Each concept builds upon the last, and I'm gaining confidence.
